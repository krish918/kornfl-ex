## Good Code

You will find **good, fine and strong codes** in recently developed pages. One example is Apptease.
I think **Apptease** contains some really nice codes as compared to older pages. Also the **new homepage,
appcetra, password recovery application, sign-up application, new profile pages** contains some extremely
useful piece of codes. Do review them, and **comment on commits** if you want to discuss them. 
 
Apptease is present in following directory structure :
 + src
   + home
     + apps
       + apptease
         + ver10
           
## Bad code

You may find some **unreasonably-resource-consuming, inefficient** codes on older pages like indexold.php or indexold2.php. 
Sorry for that. That's because, those were written when this project was inititated and I had never
written in PHP before Kornfl-ex. But, you can improve such codes if you find some, beacuse these source
codes are all yours now.
