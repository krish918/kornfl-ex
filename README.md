> If you have never wrote in **PHP or Javascript**, then it may prove a nice **place to start**.
  Just because, *I too began my first line of PHP code with the login page of Kornflex, only*. 
  
## What is Kornflex? 

Kornflex is a **PHP app**, written for college students to discover more about each other. 
It is more like a mini social networking site. Here, people can **rate each other** in the campus
on a scale of 1 to 5, show their interest in each other. They are **ranked** by the app engine on
the basis of rating data and on basis of
interest data, most interesting people in campus are sorted out.

There is a **mirror**, at every user's profile, which other people in network can use to send messages
or to tell something unusual about the user. People can share their heart by posting **Flakes**, which is 
displayed in **commonroom**.

> Complete Kornflex appoximately contains 30,000+ lines of codes. That's why you can think for making your
  hands dirty with it. 

Another app on kornflex, **Stone** acts as a knowledge management app. Their is a **quiz app** called
*apptese*, which people can play in the network to see and match their level with rest of the network.

## What I have to do exactly? ##

You are here to learn, just like I am here to learn. In Kornflex, you can find a *appreciable amount
of codes* and thus, it gives you *surplus amount of prewritten samples*, which you can study, learn and change to **create your
own apps**. If you are already aquainted with PHP & Javascript, then also you can study the codes for finding
faults and thus enriching your experience.
You can use the codes to *satisfy your needs* and for your maximum benefit.  

## Gradual Pushing ##

Not all codes will be pushed immediately. But, as you join gitHub and start watching this project, you will
get **notifications** about all update regarding this project.

## Deprecated project ##

Kornflex is a **deprecated** project. No furthur work is being done on it. Its being presented here,
**free of cost only and only for educational purpose**. Still, you can find something deep inside the core
which may find use in your own planned app. Each and every part of code is here free to use and can be implemented
and corrected in any way, after giving proper referenece to the original/first Author.
